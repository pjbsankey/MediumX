        Hayek is a token that gives investors exposure to an index of cryptocurrencies. To start with we have fixed 1 Hayek = 0.0014ETH + 0.00022BTC . In the long term we see Hayek evolving in to money and a stablecoin.

      Maybe Bitcoin is the ultimate money, but just in case it isn't we want to explore alternatives. Starting with Hayek.</p>
      <p><Hayek is a monetary experiment inspired by the belief that good money can only come from self interest not benevolence.</strong></p>
      <p>Governments are incentivised to devalue their money over time and that has largely been the history of fiat currencies. However if private banks issued their own money their incentives would be aligned with that of their customers, producing a win-win scenario.</p>
