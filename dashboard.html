    <h1>Prices Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Prices = Money Quantity x Velocity / Supply of Real Values</p>
    <p>
      The above Prices equation is derived from Jens O Parsson's book the Dying
      of Money and is another way of stating the quantity theory of money. Our
      goal as guardians of Elastix is to give each unit of currency a constant
      value. Therefore our job as currency guardians is to expand Elastix's
      supply to match exactly any increase in the supply of real values and to
      offset any decrease in velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's our belief that if we can achieve constant prices through sound money
      management then we will be doing a great service to our economy.
