      Why do we exist? We believe Jeff Snider's work at Eurodollar University
      has credibility. Since 2008 GDP has stagnated well below the previous
      decades trendline. The reason we believe is because we have been stuck in
      monetary deflation. Money is not circulating in the way our global economy
      needs. Commercial Banks are balance sheet constrained and their balance
      sheets aren't growing in the same way as they did pre 2008.

      Since 2008 the global growth paradigm changed. China is a reflection of
      what bond yields have been saying all along, that post 2008 the world has
      never recovered. China is showing symptoms of the monetary crisis in 2008
      which permanently altered banking system credit. The more nothing happens
      the greater the political and geopolitical risks. Whats really wrong with
      China is post 2008 silent depression.

      Contrary to popular opinion low interest rates are not economic stimulus.
      They are clear validated historical signals that associate with depression
      economics. The background to todays conditions remains 2008 not the
      inflationary 1970s that many market commentators believe.

      It's our opinion that if we analyse economic conditions correctly and
      expand or contract the supply of Elastica appropriately we will be at the
      beginning of creating a better medium of exchange for the world. It's a
      medium of exchange which makes money money. As a store of value many other
      assets are better, property, stocks, bitcoin, ether.

    <p>
      It's our belief that if we can achieve constant prices through sound money
      management then we will be doing a great service to our economy.
